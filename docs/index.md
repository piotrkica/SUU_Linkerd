**Linkerd** is an cloud-native example of a service mesh -- which is a way to
control how different parts of an application share data with one another.
Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a
dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. This visible
infrastructure layer can document how well (or not) different parts of an app
interact, so it becomes easier to optimize communication and avoid downtime as
an app grows. [@redhat:service-mesh]
